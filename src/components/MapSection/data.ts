In this shimmering digital mirage, award-winning artist Sara Shakeel offers a quiet reminder we are still, and always will be, human.",

BloomSynth imagines a desert of sand and ruins, where two figures gather around an artifact from the future’s past: the BloomSynth. This synthesizer conjures glitched fragments of a vanished world—roses we can no longer touch, scents we can no longer know. It stands as our only link to a time when nature thrived, now lost to forgetting.",

Savannah Spirit and Emma Shapiro’s work and the words of censored artists explain how bias, erasure, and moderation failures disrupt embodiment and creative expression. Shadows in the gallery double as censor bars and traces of disappearance, while triggered audio testimonies share artists’ lived experiences—making visible the profound impact of digital suppression on art and identity.",
