This synthesizer conjures glitched fragments of a vanished world—roses we can no longer touch, scents we can no longer know.

Rather than irony or escapism, Foam Garden explores a sincere interpretation of TOUCH GRASS—a longing for grounding, ritual, and presence. It simulates the tactile joy of nature through simple, contemplative actions in a virtual field. Foam Garden is a soft, dreamlike grass field where users can pick and place flowers throughout the space,hear a calming sound. The grass moves subtly underfoot, like dense foam, enhancing a physical sense of presence. This quiet interaction—gathering, harvesting, arranging—channels our primal relationship with land and touch, grounding the visitor in a world made of code.",
